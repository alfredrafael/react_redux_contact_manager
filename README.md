# react_redux_contact_manager
In this project I learned React from scratch, i.e. thinking in components, rendering components, JSX, managing state (with Redux), and also cutting-edge ES6 syntax and constructs. 
The first version of the project uses JSON placeholder asa mock API, and the second one relies on Firebase-Firestore as a backend.
